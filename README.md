# [Disappearing Navigational Sticky Header for Foundation 5](http://bridgetlane.github.io/disappearing-nav-sticky-header)

This is a simple framework for a functional disappearing navigational sticky header. It is built for Foundation 5. The header is built to navigate to sections of the page, but can also easily navigate to other pages on your website. The header disappears while scrolling down and reappears while scrolling upwards.

Other improvements to standard Foundation include:
+ Improvements to html head
+ Simple page framework
+ Body layout
+ CSS & JS for a navigational sticky header that disappears when scrolling
